**What is Sorted.?**

Sorted. is a project management web app, built as a way to practice my React skills. React-router is used, along with Firebase, Firestore, Firebase Auth, and Firebase Storage. There are custom hooks, contexts, and components. It was a good way to practice my React and Firebase skills 😊.
