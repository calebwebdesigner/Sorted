**What is Sorted.?**

Sorted. is a project management web app built with React. React-router was used, along with Firebase, Firestore, Firebase Auth, and Firebase Storage. There are custom hooks, contexts, and components. I utilised both global and modulised CSS styling (whichever was most suitable for the component in question). It was a good way to practice my React and Firebase skills 😊.
