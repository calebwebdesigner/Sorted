A project management web app 📝.

**What is Sorted.?**

Sorted. is a project management web app built with React. React-router was used, along with Firebase, Firestore, Firebase Auth, and Firebase Storage. There are custom hooks, contexts, and components. I utilised both global and modulised CSS styling (whichever was most suitable for the component in question). It was a good way to practice my React and Firebase skills 😊.

**Why is Sorted.?**

I wanted to practice my coding skills, and this wee web app was the result 😎.

**How is Sorted.?**

Not so bad, thanks for asking.
